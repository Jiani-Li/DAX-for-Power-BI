# In most of the case of sales dashboard, I need show the sales data in different currencies based on different years. The corporate currency is DKK.
# We have the two fact tables: FactSalesOverview andFactExchangeRates
# We also use 2 dimensional tables :DimCurrency and DimDate
# The DAX functions we have used are: VAR,SELECTEDVALUE, LOOKUPVALUE
# In order to calculate the different currencies, we also need to generate a new dimensional table:DimCurrency 
DimCurrency 
= DISTINCT(FactExchangeRates[Currency])

# First we will use the original currency of DDK to calculate the total sales amount:
TotalSales DKK = SUM(FactSalesOverview[Sales Amount DKK])

# Then we use the variables to calculate total sales in different currency:
TotalSales =
VAR SelectedDate = SELECTEDVALUE(DimDate[Year])
VAR SelectedCurrency = SELECTEDVALUE(DimCurrency[Currency])
VAR rate = DIVIDE(LOOKUPVALUE(FactExchangeRates[Exchange Rate],
                              FactExchangeRates[Currency],SelectedCurrency,

VAR result = DIVIDe([TotalSales DKK],rate)
